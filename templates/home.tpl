      <p class="card-text">Arbiter is a Legendary Support Void affinity champion from High Elves faction in Raid Shadow Legends. Arbiter is obtainable from Void Shard and by completing all the Progress Missions! She is renowned for her excellent support skills where she could revive fallen allies, apply Increase Attack buff to allow champions to deal more damage, and provide an additional Turn Meter boost to allow her allies to have an advantage in performing the attack before the enemies. Her default attack is also able to apply Weaken debuff on a single target enemy, which allows her allies to deal extra damage to that target.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Master balladeers know that a hero of legend often earns the title not just due his or her skill and courage – important as they are! – but also by heeding a greater calling. Be that timely divine intervention or a twist of fate that leads them to greatness. For Trunda Giltmallet, fate had a mystery to solve. As a young and hopeful smith apprentice, Trunda had come across a collection of strange ore nuggets during one of the mining expeditions. Elder Dwarves claimed these must have come from somewhere beyond the realms of Teleria. And indeed, they were nothing like she had seen before, harder than steel and buzzing with hidden power. No hammer could break them, no smelter had heat enough to bend this mysterious metal to its will. The magical properties of the ore were clear, and Trunda had spent well over a decade being tutored by the very best artisans the Dwarven Kingdom had to offer before she finally prevailed. With dragonbone dust and alchemical fire, with rune-incrusted instruments and water from the purest mountain streams, Trunda forged a mighty mallet from the star-metal ore.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Sethallia</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Lady Sethallia hails from the coast of the Land of Rebirth, South of the Castle of Kaerok itself. Her ancestral fief grants control of much of the province, making Sethallia a well-known face at court as well as one of King Tayba’s important vassals. Fiery-tempered and charismatic, she has earned as many enemies among the King’s bannermen as she did friends. Her brash nature is well known even among Sethallia’s own people, although it seems her soldiers have grown to adore and respect it. A widely-quoted story tells of her bravery when a small force of Kaerok knights fell into an orc ambush. Seeing a hulking orс chief fell a dozen of her men in that battle, Sethallia cut her way through to the beast and mocked him brazenly.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Cardiel</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Cardiel has a unique passive skill “Fiend Warden” that reduces the damage that allies take from Demonspawn, Undead Hordes and Knight Revenant champions! This passive skill is a powerful counter against Arena Defense Blender Team comprising champions from those factions (e.g. Skullcrown, Sinesha). In addition, it enables him to self Ally Join Attack whenever his allies attack the enemy. This synergizes well with his A1 skill “Cow the Wicked” that heals all of his allies whenever he attacks. However, it only truly shines when the passive skill is fully booked to increase the success rate. He also has a useful Speed Aura in all battles, which enables you to use him as a Leader to boost allies base speed especially in Arena. </p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Siphi the Lost Bride</h5>
      <p class="card-text">There is another tale of love well known in Kaerok and Arnoc, but one much darker than Minaya’s and Khoronar’s adventures. It starts with a bold young nobleman, whose family had lost everything but their title; their lands, their estates, their wealth – all had been seized to repay debts accumulated over generations of careless debauchery. This left Rotos with little to his name except for his pride and his skill with the rapier. Though that barely stopped the young man from spending his youth duelling, drinking, and racking up new debts. It was only when the danger of assassins sent by the usurers became real that he finally realized it was time to disappear, at least for a time. Although his talents were limited and so were the fields where Rotos could employ them in full, he had chosen a career many would not have considered – that of a pirate. </p>
